## 👨‍💻 About This Repository

This repository contains my personal engineering portfolio, built as a static site and deployed using GitHub Pages.

The purpose of this portfolio is to present:

- Backend-oriented projects
- Database modeling and SQL work
- Architectural thinking and system design decisions
- Engineering fundamentals applied across different stacks

Rather than focusing on a single framework, this portfolio reflects my foundation in software engineering principles that translate across technologies.
